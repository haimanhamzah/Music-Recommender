# Music-Recommender
### This repository was a project used with Spotify Web API - Spotipy to recommend users music based on multiple different factors

Digital music streaming lets users browse millions of tracks from numerous artists, genres, and eras. Given the plethora of musical content, finding new songs and singers that suit one's tastes may be difficult. Music recommendation algorithms are changing how consumers find and engage with music. A variety of algorithms are used to recommend songs, artists, and playlists to users based on their listening history, tastes, and behaviour. These complicated systems combine collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and matrix factorization to provide tailored and relevant music selections for each user. A music recommendation system optimizes the user's experience by helping them find new music that matches their tastes and explore a wide range of musical material. The dataset, approach, and assessment criteria utilized to build a music recommendation system are examined in this paper. This study uses user listening histories, song metadata, and user-song interactions to train and evaluate recommendation systems. More specifically, we will demonstrate how Spotify Web API, spotipy, numpy, pandas, fuzzy matching, and other Python modules were integrated into this project. Additionally, this research examines the challenges and considerations of building a music recommendation system. The material addresses data sparsity, cold-start, and scalability 
issues. It also proposes solutions and development areas. In summary, this study analyses music recommendation system construction and evaluation. Advanced algorithms and user data improve the user experience, ease music exploration, and make personalized suggestions. This work contributes to music recommendation system research and development.
